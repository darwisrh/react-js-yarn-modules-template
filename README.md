## This is a React JS with yarn modules template

If you wanna make your own react app, start with :

```
npx create-react-app [folder name]
```
And then delete the 'node_modules' folder and the 'package-lock.json' file and you can now install yarn with npm :
```
npm install --global yarn
```
after that you need to install the yarn modules, just type this on your terminal :
```
yarn add [package name]
```
And now you can write React JS and install the library with yarn.
